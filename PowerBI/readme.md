> The most profitable customers segment - **Best Customers**. They have highest frequency and monetary scores. Although the customers are quite active (purchases are recent), they should be awarded for loyalty with exceptional deals dedicated to them.
> **Big spenders** - the 2nd highest monetary rate, but their purchases are average recency. We should provide them with more targeted/personalized offers.
> 
> **Can't lose them** - although the customers have lower than average monetary base and average frequency, they still add up to the business revenue, these should receive some exceptional attention: combined personalized deals, inclusion into loyalty program, awards for purchases.
> 
> **Recent customers** - loyalty program should be provided to them. Their purchase should followed up with asking for the feedback, providing loyalty program and keeping them informed about the best deals.

> The most profitable customers segment - **Best Customers**. They have highest frequency and monetary scores. Although the customers are quite active (purchases are recent), they should be awarded for loyalty with exceptional deals dedicated to them.
> **The lost customers** segment takes almost the same part from total customers number as the best customers.
> The good sign here is that we have the widest best customers segment (considering that we took best scores).
>
> **Recent customers** - the ones who have purchased recently but have no loyalty, are first-timers, etc. These take also pretty considerable part of all customer base and they require a lot of attention.
>
> **11% require especially urgent and clear attention**, since their purchase was quite a while ago (3/4 quartiles) but they have at least average monetary score.
> **Loyal customers** base is quite small, so this shows that we need to grow regular buyers base (even if it's average spending).
