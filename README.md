---
> TASK:
> - You got a follow up task from your product manager to give stats on how subscriptions churn looks like from a weekly retention standpoint. Your PM argues that to view retention numbers on a monthly basis takes too long and important insights from data might be missed out.
> - You remember learning previously that cohorts analysis can be really helpful in such cases. You should provide weekly subscriptions data that shows how many subscribers started their subscription in a particular week and how many remain active in the following 6 weeks. Your end result should show weekly retention cohorts for each week of data available in the dataset and their retention from week 0 to week 6.

> TASK:
> - Your task is to build useful funnel chart from raw_events table data.
> - 1. Analyze the data in raw_events table. Spend time querying the table, getting more familiar with data. Identify events captured by users visiting the website.
> - 2. Now that you have your unique events table create a sales funnel chart from events in it. Not all events are relevant, productive to be used in this chart. Identify & collect data that you think could be used
> - Create a table showing the numbers of events' that you want to use in the funnel analysis. Add event_order and  the percentage drop off values, as in the Example:

> TASK:
> You've been tasked to populate the 'Overview' sheet with analytical insight:
> 1. Business would like to see the monthly sales trend.
> 2. They would also like to evaluate online vs non-online orders.
>   
>    It would be nice for business to have an overview of:
>    1. The delivery performance trend (orderdate & Shipdate lag)
>    2. Top salesperson by sales, by volume.
>    3. Top countries.
>    4. Top sales reasons
>    5. Maybe you have an idea for business what could be interesting to look into from this data?
