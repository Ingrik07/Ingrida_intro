# DA.PY.3.5

## Data visualisation with Python

Please check it out in the [repository](https://github.com/TuringCollegeSubmissions/ingrii-PYDA.3.5/blob/main/coursera-course-analysis-ivinskaite-2024.ipynb).

### Goal of the analysis

The analysis is conducted to answer the most crucial Coursera Course questions, undercover the most impactful insights.
Data analysis visualsations tools are used to answer the questions what is the correlation of the students number enrolled and course ratings.
Also, the relation between the course difficulty and ratings, students enrolled is calculated.

## Conclusion
1. There are 154 organizations with 891 courses in the dataset.

2. There are 4 difficulty levels:

Beginner with 487 courses.
Intermediate with 198 courses.
Mixed with 187 courses.
Advanced with 1 course.


3. There are 3 course types:
   
COURSE with 582 courses
SPECIALIZATION with 297 courses
PROFESSIONAL CERTIFICATE with 12 courses
Course Rating by Certificate Type:
This boxplot shows the distribution of course ratings for each certificate type. It appears that the distribution of ratings is fairly similar across different certificate types, with most ratings clustered around high values (close to 5).

### Course Rating by Difficulty Level:
This boxplot shows the distribution of course ratings for each difficulty level. It indicates that beginner and intermediate courses have a high concentration of ratings around 4.5 to 5, whereas advanced and mixed-level courses show a slightly wider spread in ratings.

### The course difficulty levelt vs enrolled students
The impact of course difficulty is visible one: most of the students choose Mixed or Beginner studies.

### Course rating
Course rating seems to have almost no impact for students enrolled.
7 best rated organizations have a rating 4.9 and have only one course.


## Improvements for the future analysis
To calculate correlations better some statistical analysis should be done.
To find the reasoning behind the best course ratings and the popularity, more digging should be done.
